# MapWorks

This is my current and aruguably the most ambitious project to date, afterall I am hosting my entire city in a visually-pleasing interactive graph(map) for everyone to use so this might be my first open-source piece of work. This is still in its early design stages so I have not posted anything on github yet, however signifacant progress has been made and I will get this completed before summer'20.
